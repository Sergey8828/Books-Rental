# BookRental
This application is a booking system for managing books. Data Model and Entity Framework Integration: The application interacts with a database using Entity Framework. Loading Data: On window load, the application retrieves distinct genres from the BookTbls table and populates a ComboBox (cbxGenre) with these genres along with an option to view all genres ("All"). It also displays a DataGrid (dgBooks) with a list of books and another DataGrid (dgBookings) with a list of bookings.
Searching Books: Users can search for available books based on selected genre and date range. The application queries the database to find books that are not booked within the specified date range for the selected genre.
Booking a Book: When a user selects a book from the list of available books (lbxBooks) and clicks the "Book" button (btnBook), the application creates a new booking record in the BookingTbls table with the selected book, start date, and end date. It then refreshes the list of bookings (dgBookings).
Deleting Bookings: Users can delete bookings by selecting a booking from the list of bookings (dgBookings) and clicking the "Delete" button (btnDelete). The application removes the selected booking from the database and refreshes the list of bookings.
Validation and UI Interaction: The application enables/disables buttons (btnSearch, btnBook, btnDelete) based on user actions and selections to ensure proper interaction flow.
Overall, this application provides functionality for managing bookings of books, allowing users to search for available books within a specified date range and make bookings accordingly.
